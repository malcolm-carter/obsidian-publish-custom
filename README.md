# Obsidian Publish Customizations

This repository contains CSS and JavaScript customizations for [my Obsidian Publish site](https://malcolmcarter.net). These are used to improve readability and remove default branding.

## Files

- `publish.css` – Adjusts page layout, column widths, and maximum readable width.
- `publish.js` – Dynamically disables the "Powered by Obsidian" label in graph view.

## Purpose

These customizations reflect a minimalist and performance-aware approach to presentation, aimed at improving readability.
